The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) is a unit under the Prime Minister's Office responsible for national security planning and coordination.

NSCS works with agencies and stakeholders to develop and co-ordinate strategies to address national security concerns. NSCS also works with agencies to anticipate and identify emergent security risks, and to build up capabilities and resources to deal with these.

## Vision
A secure & resilient nation:
A networked government, a cohesive society, an engaged people.

## Mission
We strive to integrate the many parts and agencies which collectively ensure Singapore's National Security by looking ahead, catalysing capability development and creating shared central awareness - to be a collaborative pathfinder to all.
