The National Security Coordination Secretariat organised the 8th International Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning Symposium (IRAHSS 2019) on 23 and 24 July 2019 at the Raffles City Convention Centre, Singapore. IRAHSS 2019 is part of the Singapore Foresight Week, held from 23-26 July 2019.

The theme of "The Future Reimagined‚Äù was chosen to get speakers and participants to envision the future together from three perspectives: geopolitics, security and society. Bringing together 22 thought leaders from various backgrounds, featuring 18 talks and four panel discussions, the symposium aims to distil key scenario vignettes so that we can be better prepared for the future.
