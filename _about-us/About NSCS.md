The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) is a unit under the Prime Minister's Office responsible for national security planning and coordination.

NSCS works with agencies and stakeholders to develop and co-ordinate strategies to address national security concerns. NSCS also works with agencies to anticipate and identify emergent security risks, and to build up capabilities and resources to deal with these.
